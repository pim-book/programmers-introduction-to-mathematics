The incident occurred Wednesday evening at the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain. Before the shooting, the suspect was in a "disciplinary dispute," said Lynn Ricci, a hospital spokeswoman. The victims, identified as Lynn Trask and Robert Barlucci, were in serious but stable condition after the shooting, Ricci said. Authorities arrested the suspect, Victor Valcarcel, later at his home, Ricci said. The 228-bed hospital was on lockdown for a period of time after the shooting.
