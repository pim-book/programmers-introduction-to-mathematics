Damaged oil barge is drained, relocated
"Since operations began Friday, 100 bags of oiled debris and 40 bags of oiled sorbents have been collected," a Coast Guard statement said. "A total of 4,700 feet of hard containment boom has been deployed in an effort to minimize environmental damage." The drained barge has been taken to a repair facility in West Wego. The Coast Guard estimates the total of leaked oil at less than 10,000 gallons. The spill started after a tanker barge towed by a motorized vessel, Settoon, ran into a construction barge towed by the tugboat Alydar just before 2 a.m. Friday near Reserve in St. John Parish, west of New Orleans. U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Lt. Suzanne Kerver said the tanker barge suffered a 10 feet by 5 feet gash above the water line, allowing crude oil to spill out of the 214,000-gallon tank. The river was closed to commercial traffic for several hours Friday before it was reopened.
