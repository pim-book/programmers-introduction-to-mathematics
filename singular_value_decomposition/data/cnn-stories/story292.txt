TSA to test new screening for elderly
Beginning Monday, the TSA will test procedures allowing those passengers to leave their shoes on, as well as light outerwear. Other changes are intended to reduce the likelihood that older passengers will be subjected to a pat-down. Some airports want private screeners The tests will be conducted at four airports: Chicago's O'Hare, Denver International, Portland International in Oregon, and Orlando International. If they are successful, the TSA could expand the procedures to checkpoints nationwide. The new protocols closely parallel changes implemented last fall for passengers age 12 and under, and for the same reason -- intelligence indicates that they are unlikely to be involved in a terrorist attack, the TSA said. TSA spokesman Greg Soule said the agency is trying to "move away from the one-size-fits-all approach" to security screening. The changes will manage risk, but not eliminate it, he said. FAA changes safety reporting culture At the selected checkpoints, passengers 75 and older will be allowed to leave their shoes and light outerwear on. If the full-body scanner detects an anomaly, the passenger will be allowed a second pass through the machine to resolve the issue. If the matter is still unresolved, the TSA screeners will be able to use other methods, such as an explosive trace detection test, before subjecting the traveler to a physical pat down. Passengers may be required to remove shoes and may still undergo a pat-down if anomalies persist. TSA officers will make a visual assessment to determine which passengers are 75 or older, the agency said. The TSA said the new procedures will allow officers to better focus on passengers who may be more likely to pose a risk to transportation while expediting the screening process.
