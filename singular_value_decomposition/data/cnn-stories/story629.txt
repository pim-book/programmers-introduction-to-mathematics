Fire leaves Costa cruise ship adrift
The ship, the Allegra, is a sister of the Costa Concordia, which wrecked off the coast of Italy on January 13, killing at least 21 people. The fire left the Allegra without propulsion, although its communications equipment is intact, the authorities said. The Allegra's fire has been put out, and the passengers are all in good health, the authorities said. The Seychelles is sending a tug, and merchant ships in the area are steaming toward the Allegra, the coast guard said.
