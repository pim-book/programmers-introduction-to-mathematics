Hundreds mourn slain Ohio student
"I just can't believe what happened. He was honestly the sweetest person I've ever met. He's such a good person and I can't believe he's gone," said Parmertor's friend, Gabby Cveljo, CNN affiliate WEWS reported. Funeral services for the slain student were held at the Church of St. Mary in Chardon, Ohio, the network said. Mourners marched silently to the church, carrying the American flag. Others had signs with hearts and stood outside, wrapped in blankets against the cold. Parmertor was killed this week when a lone gunman opened fire on students in Chardon High School's cafeteria. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire. The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Authorities say T.J. Lane, 17, is charged him with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. The latter is related to the student who was grazed by a bullet. Prosecutor David Joyce filed charges against Lane on Thursday in juvenile court. The defendant's next court appearance will be Tuesday, and a hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged in an assault on another woman. "I think there's a lot of kids that go through things like that. That doesn't give them the right to kill other people," said Bob Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's grandfather. "No one has the right to shoot other people because they've had a rough life."
