Service set for Ohio shooting victim
A visitation was set for Hewlin at Burr Funeral Home in Chardon ahead of Tuesday's funeral Mass, the same day accused shooter T.J. Lane heads back to court. Hewlin was killed last week when a lone gunman opened fire on students in Chardon High School's cafeteria. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire. The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people about 30 miles east of Cleveland. A funeral service for Daniel Parmertor, 16, was held Saturday. A service for the third victim, 17-year-old Russell D. King, is scheduled for Thursday. Authorities say Lane, 17, is charged with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. The latter is related to the student who was grazed by a bullet. Prosecutor David Joyce filed charges against Lane in juvenile court. The defendant's next court appearance will be Tuesday, and a hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged in an assault on another woman.
