Scout to cookie $$ thief: Gonna get you
The incident left one of the girls slightly injured after she held on to the getaway car to stop it from leaving the scene, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. It started when a passenger got out of a car Saturday and pretended to be interested in the cookies the girls were selling outside a grocery store, according to the affiliate. He grabbed the cash box and ran, leaving the girls stunned outside a Walmart store in Fort Bend County. Girl Scout Iravia Cotton pursued the man to his car. "I started hitting the boy in the passenger seat," Cotton told the affiliate. "So I think he learned his lesson a little bit ... and then they dragged my friend Rachel across the street." Rachel Johnson told the affiliate she got a few bumps and scratches when she held onto the back bumper to stop the car from driving away. "I hope your face hurts from where Iravia punched you, jerk, bam," Johnson said in a message to the thieves. "I hope your face hurts and I hope it leaves a scar. Who steals money from Girl Scouts, I mean, really?" The cash box contained about $200, according to the affiliate. Girl Scouts are financially responsible for any cookies they order, troop leader Jean Marie Johnson said. Authorities said the suspects covered their license tag during the incident. An investigation is under way.
