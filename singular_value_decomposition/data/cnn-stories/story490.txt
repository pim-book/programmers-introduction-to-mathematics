Obama will address the media Tuesday afternoon, his first formal news conference since last year, the White House said. White House officials did not say what the topic of the news conference would be. Obama's remarks will come before the pivotal results are tallied from Super Tuesday, the Republican battle for voters in 10 states. His remarks also come one day after Obama met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two leaders spoke about Iran's nuclear program and other Middle East issues amid speculation that Israel may attack nuclear sites in Iran.
