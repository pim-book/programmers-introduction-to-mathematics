Iran to reveal nuclear achievements
Ahmadinejad did not offer details during his announcement at a rally to mark the 33rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. But he slammed "hegemonic powers," accusing them of pressuring the nation on the nuclear front. In the near future, Iran's nuclear demands will be met by the nation's scientists, Ahmadinejad said at the Tehran event broadcast on Press TV "Today you see that the Iranian nation has become nuclear and can supply many of its demands," he said. " And God willing, in next few days, the whole world will witness the inauguration of several major achievements in the nuclear domain. The news comes amid heightened tension between Iran and the West over its nuclear program. The West believes Tehran may be trying to develop nuclear weapons, but Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program is solely for civilian energy production. Tensions hit a boiling point weeks ago when Iran conducted military exercises in the Persian Gulf after threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping lane for oil. Iran's threat followed tough sanctions from Western nations aimed at stopping its suspected nuclear weapons program.
