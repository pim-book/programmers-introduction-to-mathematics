Ten other children were injured, including two critically, according to the Indianapolis Fire Department. The girl killed in the wreck was estimated to be 5 or 6 years old. The wreck happened just before 8 a.m. on Emerson Avenue in southeastern Indianapolis, the fire department said. An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way. Witnesses said they saw nothing unusual before the bus hit an abutment beneath a concrete overpass, according to fire department spokeswoman Rita Burris. Officials are waiting for a coroner's report to determine if the driver had a medical condition that could have contributed to the wreck.
