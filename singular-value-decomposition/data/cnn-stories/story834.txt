Woman called witch, burned alive
Dhegani Mahato was attacked and set on fire by family members and others after a shaman allegedly accused her of casting a spell to make one of her relatives sick, Police Officer Hira Mani Baral said. The attack occurred Friday in Bagauda in Chitwan district, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, Baral said by telephone. Police arrested 10 people, including two shamans, five women and an 8-year-old boy, in connection with the burning. "Those arrested have confessed to their crime and will be charged with murder," Baral said. Mahato had just finished cleaning a cowshed early in the morning when she was attacked, Baral said. She was beaten with sticks and rocks before being doused with kerosene and set afire, an attack witnessed by her 9-year-old daughter, according to the local police report. Neighbors told police they were alerted to the attack but by then it was too late to save her. Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai appealed to the people not to heed to shamans and faith healers. The government announced 1 million Nepalese rupees (about $14,000) in compensation for Mahato's two children.
