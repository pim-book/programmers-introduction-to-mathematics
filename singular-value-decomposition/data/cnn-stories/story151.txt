'The Situation' explains drug problem
A statement was posted on the reality-TV personality's official website Wednesday, after denying online reports that he checked into rehab. "Don't believe everything you read or hear," he tweeted Tuesday. He used his Twitter account to distribute his new statement, which was titled "The Situation Wants to Set The Record Straight." "I have voluntarily taken steps to get control of a prescription medication problem I had due to exhaustion," his statement said. "I have spent the past several weeks getting treatment for this problem and recuperating from my work and appearance schedule. I appreciate my fans support and love you guys." "Jersey Shore" ended its fifth season this month, but MTV has renewed the show for a sixth season.
