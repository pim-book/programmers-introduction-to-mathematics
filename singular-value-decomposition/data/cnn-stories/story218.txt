Burial for soldier killed in rescue try
The funeral took place, as scheduled, in the early morning, said cemetery spokeswoman Jennifer Lynch. Chief Warrant Officer II Edward Duane Cantrell, 36, was a member of the 3rd Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg. The Green Beret had returned in August from his latest overseas deployment. His wife, Louise, told officials the family was upstairs when the fire broke out just before 2 a.m. March 5 in Hope Mills, a suburb of Fayetteville. She jumped from a second-floor window and ran next door to call for help while her husband went to get 6-year-old Isabella and 4-year-old Natalia, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said. "They never made it out," said Debbie Tanna, spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office. Officials believe the family's century-old home had tinderbox conditions that led to "a very intense fire." Military officials said the Fort Bragg soldier had completed six deployments, including one to Iraq and five to Afghanistan. He had four Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart for his service, according to the Army Special Operations Command. Cantrell was honored with a military funeral at the cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. "That was his wishes," said Lt. April Olsen of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. His two daughters will lie beside him.
