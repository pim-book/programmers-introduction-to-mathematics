Judge stabbed, officer shot in Wash.
Undersheriff Rick Scott said the man gave his name as Michael Thomas when the officer approached him shortly after noon inside the Grays Harbor County Courthouse in Montesano. "He attacked her with a sharp-edged instrument," Scott said. "The judge rushed to the aid of the officer and actually struck the suspect physically, knocking him off of the deputy." The suspect cut Superior Court Judge David Edwards in the neck. Deputy Polly Davin attempted to draw her weapon, but the suspect was able to knock her to the floor and take her weapon, officials said. The suspect fired twice, hitting the deputy once in the shoulder. Seattle affiliate KING said the man left the courthouse with the handgun. Edwards and Davin were in satisfactory condition at Grays Harbor Community Hospital, spokesman David Quigg said. "They are comfortable and doing well," said Quigg, declining to detail the extent of their injuries. The suspect was still on the loose, Scott told CNN. CNN Seattle affiliate KIRO aired footage of officers in a residential neighborhood in Montesano. "They believe he could be in a location in the area," said Trooper Russ Winger, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol. "They believe he is armed." Scott said officials were not certain of the suspect's true identity. The incident occurred in Montesano, the county seat for Grays Harbor County, west of Olympia and near the Pacific Coast. Many offices and buildings were placed in lockdown. According to KIRO, a man garnered the attention of courthouse employees and the officer approached him. The suspect was well-dressed and possibly carrying a briefcase, Winger said. Montesano Police did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment. Gov. Chris Gregoire appointed Edwards to the bench in December 2007.
