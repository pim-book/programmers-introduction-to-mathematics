Strong earthquake hits Japan
The Japanese Meteorological Agency issued a brief tsunami advisory, warning of a half-meter wave. The tsunami advisory was called off a short time after the agency issued it. The quake was centered about 270 kilometers (170 miles) off the east coast. There were no immediate reports of damage, police said. This temblor comes three days after the one-year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands in Japan, and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter century.
