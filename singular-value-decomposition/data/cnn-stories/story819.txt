Missing teen mom, child found dead
Thomas Lorde, the estranged boyfriend of 19-year-old Latasha Jackson and the father of 1-year-old Chaniya Wynn, was found next to them, dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said Sunday. Cleveland police issued an Amber Alert on Saturday after witnesses reported seeing Jackson and Chaniya abducted while walking on East 72nd Avenue in Cleveland. Jackson's 14-year-old brother was walking with the pair when he said Lorde approached. "He walked up on us and ... he pulled out the gun. He pointed it at me," the brother told CNN affiliate WEWS. "He told me to run." The brother, who CNN is not identifying because of his age, ran home and called 911. "I was scared for my niece and my sister," he said. "She (Jackson) was silent. She was scared. She didn't know what to do." The alert named Lorde, 25, as the kidnapping suspect, warning that he was a "violent sexual predator with felony warrants out of New York," and armed and dangerous. The alert was lifted Sunday after police found the bodies of the three "in a closed garage of an unoccupied structure in the 7000 block of Union Avenue," a police statement said. "All three were found unresponsive with gunshot wounds and pronounced dead on the scene," the statement said. No other details of the investigation were made public.
