2 killed in Colorado wildfire
The blaze has already killed two people and damaged 27 structures. Authorities warned thousands that they had to evacuate. Firefighters have struggled to extinguish the blaze, which was fueled by high winds and dry conditions. As of late Wednesday morning, 3,790 acres were burned and the fire remained completely uncontained, said Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Some winds expected Wednesday could move smoke over Denver and cause haze, but it will likely be high enough not to cause serious problems, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. At one point Tuesday, residents of 6,500 homes in the area near the fire were told they might have to evacuate, but they were later told they did not need to, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said. A search-and-rescue team of 32 people and six search dogs concentrated on finding a missing woman who was last seen at her home that was destroyed by the fire, the sheriff's office said. Jefferson County Coroner John Graham identified the two people killed as Samuel Lucas, 77, and Linda Lucas, 76. Linda Lucas' remains were discovered at the couple's residence first; Samuel Lucas' remains were recovered Tuesday. Although he didn't have exact causes of death, Graham said he suspects the deaths were fire-related. "They were found very close together. One was found outside; one was found inside," Kelley said. Officials were trying to determine why the couple had not left the fire zone by Monday night. Kelley provided little information on the missing person. "It is a woman who lives within the area that was pretty heavily damaged," she said. Authorities were trying to determine if the wildfire was started after a controlled burn in the area crept outside a perimeter and swept through the area.
