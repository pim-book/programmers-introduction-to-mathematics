Queen stuns couple, attends wedding
She showed up. Despite their shock, the groom had the presence of mind to bow, and the bride to curtsey as the monarch appeared and congratulated them, amateur video of the event showed.

Queen Elizabeth was in Manchester Friday on official duties that included visits to Central Manchester University Hospitals and a new BBC complex. She is making appearances around the country this spring as she celebrates her Diamond Jubilee, marking her 60 years on the throne.
